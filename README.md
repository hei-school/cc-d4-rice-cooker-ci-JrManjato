# Rice Cooker App

This is a command-line Rice Cooker application implemented in four different languages (Typescript, Ruby, Dart, and Javascript). The program allows users to perform various Rice Cooker-related actions, including adding rice, cooking rice, keeping warm, and removing rice.

We can find the 4 implementations of the program in the different languages by browsing the branch corresponding to each language.

- Javascript in the branch [feature/javascript](https://github.com/hei-school/cc-d4-rice-cooker-ci-JrManjato/tree/feature/javascript).
- Dart in the branch [feature/dart](https://github.com/hei-school/cc-d4-rice-cooker-ci-JrManjato/tree/feature/dart).
- Ruby in the branch [feature/ruby](https://github.com/hei-school/cc-d4-rice-cooker-ci-JrManjato/tree/feature/ruby).
